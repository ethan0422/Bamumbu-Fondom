            The Fondom has being existing since the Precolonial 15th century.The name came from “mbu”, meaning cave. Bamumbu therefore means “People of caves”. In
            the early points in her origin, Bamumbu ancestors lived in caves for safety and from where they
            launched attacks to conquer new territories.
            The founder of BAMUMBU was PRINCE KETUMONGUH who left MENKA with his supporters
            in search of a new lands to create his own Fondom after a Royal succession dispute at the
            Royal Court of the Grand Widikum Tribe.
            Descendants of Ketumagu who had a succession dispute with his brothers in Widikum at about
            15th century AD left with his two brothers Jongleku and Nkemna northward towards and settled
            at Tadkon (present day batibo). The next generation migrated further north and settled in besi
            and then Bamesong (present day Ashong), then moved slightly northwest to Gobe.
            In the 17th century Chamayah emerged as head of nthe family and moved further from Gobe
            and settled at Achuabeh (interpreted as Hill Top) which is present-day Fomenji.
            From 1884-1885 during the Franco-British war against the Germans for the annexation of the
            cameroons, chamayah and his people moved further down the hill to settle in the valley (Mbu) at
            Nvueh-Mezuh. Here the first palace was built thus the Bamumbu (Mbu) was established.
            In Nvueh- Mezuh, chamaya went for fishing and found Namambu the daughter of Megum
            (Folepi) who had earlier migrated from wedikum through Besi and settled at mechiebie. They
            got married latter and at his death had no children together.
            As a widow Namambu remarried his successor and they gave birth to what latter became. <br> <br>
            <b> “The nine sons of Namambu”.</b> <br> <br>
            1) Metangama <br>
            2) Fombele <br>
            3) Nyamesheke <br>
            4) Nkweta Nyonga <br>
            5) Fomenji <br>
            6) Fonenge <br>
            7) Formakang <br>
            8) Forka <br>
            9) Fondah <br>
            Most of the sons left the palace and set up their own subchiefdoms in a united Fondom under
            the paramount ruler of the Bamumbu People.
            The present palace is situated at Nchingang just about a kilometer
            from the site of the first palace.

            <br> <b>GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION</b> <br>
            Bamumbu is a Bantu clan of the mundani tribe. The Bamumbu people speak native mundani language. The clan lies in the Mount Bamboutos Caldera, located between latitudes 5˚44' and 5˚36'N and longitudes 9˚55' and 10˚07'E, and extending from an altitude of 200 m to 2700 m above sea level, is typical of a multi-agricultural production system in the western highlands of Cameroon. It receives between 2000 - 3000 mm of rainfall annually and the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures are 32˚C and 17˚C, respectively. The geographical location of the clan is unique in the it is the only habitable Caldera along the Cameroon volcanic line (CVL). It occupies 2/3 of the total land surface and population of the Mundani Tribe. Alongside the Nweh Tribe they constituted two Native Authorities before independence, which were later merged after assessment to create the Nweh-Mundani Council Area. Later this changed to Fontem Sub Division, which is the present day Lebialem Division of the south west region.
            The Bamumbu Fondom/clan share boundaries with four major administrative divisions of Cameroon (Menoua, Bamboutos, Mezam and momo). Bamumbu equally has three vegetation zones (forest, savanna and sahelian) that favors all systems of agriculture thus making it Cameroon in miniature. <br>

            <b> POPULATION.</b> <br>
            BAMUMBU has an estimated population of 65000 inhabitants occupying a total land surface of about 1000 km2 with huge tourist, and agricultural potentials.
            A significant proportion of its population resides out of the clan/Fondom, with about 30 000 people in some parts of Littoral and West Region where they form whole villages.
            <br>
            <b> AGRICULTURE </b> <br>
            More than 98% of the local population depends on subsistence farming and some small scale of commercial agriculture by the sale of produce from cash crops. This agriculture is supplemented by petit trading, fishing, hunting and transport services dominated by bike riders most particularly during the dry season though practiced by a minute proportion of the population. The agro-pastoral activities practiced in the Bamumbu follow the bioclimatic condition of the area. Parts of the lower belt practice the cultivation of cash crops such as palm oil, cocoa, Robusta coffee, gathering of non-timber forest products, and food crops like plantains, cocoyam, cassavas bananas, pepper etc. The degree of palm oil cultivation in the lower belt is modest as compared to other parts of the tribe (Mundani). Meanwhile the extremes of the upper belt practice the cultivation of market gardening products like Irish potatoes, cabbages, carrots, garlic and licks, sweet yams, ginger etc. The intensity of market gardening in the Upper belt is very high. As well the rearing of cattle, goats, sheep and chicken etc. (Nkemteba J.T, 2002) and field survey by CEPLODEV team for WCD. The high intensity of market gardening products in the upper belt results to a higher per capital income to local farmers of this zone as compared to the lower zone where the local farmers have lower income earnings. This thus impacts the upper belt with increased economic activities by the presence of bigger markets. These increase agricultural activities generate secondary activities like transportation and commercial activities that lead to increase trade activities with the bordering Towns of Dschang, Mbouda and Bafoussam.

        <p>
            The area experiences two seasons – the dry season that begins in November and ends in March and the rainy season that commences in April and stretches up to October. It has three zones owing to the difference in topography and vegetation. The lower belt popularly called lower Bamumbu has a characteristic mild temperature. The upper belt (North West) is tropical savanna with an altitude of up to 2100 m. Here the temperatures can go below 18 °C in the months of December to January. <br>

            <b> Hydrology </b> <br>
            The main rivers and streams in the area are found in the lower belt. There are equally many drinkable springs in the whole of the Bamumbu area. The main river of the Condom is known as River Meyi gets it rise from Mount Bamboutous and to it is added many other tributaries like Mezuu, metchep, Funi, Mantop, and Macap as it runs downstream resulting in River Manyu. During the rainy season, many of these streams overflow their banks and become fast-flowing and dangerous to cross. The upper tropical savanna area of M’mouck Leteh, Atsuala, Magha and Fonenge have few streams and springs, many of which dry off in the dry season leading to acute water shortage both for household use and irrigation. <br>

            <b> Vegetation</b> <br>
            There are two distinct vegetation types within the Bamumbu area. There is the wooded savanna in the lower part around the villages of Tatung, Along Kong, Nchingang and Banteng and the tropical savanna vegetation at the higher attitudes of M’mouck Leteh, Atsuala, Marita and Magha. The lower wooded zone hold the highest level of flora – timber and non-timber forest species including medicinal plants. Much of the primary forest have been converted to secondary forests and void of major timber species. The tropical savanna zone has grassy vegetation, with isolated patches of forest (stunted trees) or planted eucalyptus trees.
            <br>
            <b> Fauna </b> <br>
            The difference in vegetation type gives rise to a variety of wildlife species (mammals, reptiles, birds and insects). The Environment and Rural Development Foundation (ERUDEF) has listed a number of animal species that could be found in the forest and grassland vegetation of the Bamumbu Court Area – some that are rare or endangered. Amongst others are the primates (chimpanzees and western lowland mountain gorillas) to wild cats like African civets, genets, foxes, stone hayracks, antelopes, deer, cameras, grass cutters and a variety of avifauna species like the banaman turacle, parrots etc. For fear of extermination of the above-mentioned primates the ERUDEF is working alongside the Ministry of Wildlife to create a sanctuary in the form of a community forest though without some resistance from a fraction of the local population.

            <p>
                The Bamumbu court area has two distinct vegetation types of forest and savanna. While the forest vegetation demonstrates a great diversity of forest species including plants and animals, the savanna type holds great touristic sites including beautiful sceneries of savanna vegetation, the plateau and vegetation itself, the slopes and more particularly the beautiful mountainous landscape in the upper zones. The tropical forest of the lower zone holds a great diversity of wildlife that attracts researchers and conservationists. Outstanding touristic features include Mount Magha, Mount Mangwa (“Mont Bamboutus”), the Ndeoh Waterfall and wabane at the "Twin Tree" which marks the boundary between bamumbu, Bechati and Folepi.

                Bamumbu have three distinct topographical regions. The landform is undulating and characterized by elevated, prominent mountainous terrain, with altitude ranging from Alongkong (1470 m) to M’mouck Leteh (2200 m). Hill slopes are steep to very steep, narrow boulder strewn crests and deeply incised valleys. The area of Mmuock Leteh is equally undulating but with broad hilltops and gentle slopes suitable for development and intensive vegetable farming.
