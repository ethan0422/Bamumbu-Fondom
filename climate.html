            The area experiences two seasons – the dry season that begins in November and ends in March and the rainy season that commences in April and stretches up to October. It has three zones owing to the difference in topography and vegetation. The lower belt popularly called lower Bamumbu has a characteristic mild temperature. The upper belt (North West) is tropical savanna with an altitude of up to 2100 m. Here the temperatures can go below 18 °C in the months of December to January. <br>

            <b> Hydrology </b> <br>
            The main rivers and streams in the area are found in the lower belt. There are equally many drinkable springs in the whole of the Bamumbu area. The main river of the Condom is known as River Meyi gets it rise from Mount Bamboutous and to it is added many other tributaries like Mezuu, metchep, Funi, Mantop, and Macap as it runs downstream resulting in River Manyu. During the rainy season, many of these streams overflow their banks and become fast-flowing and dangerous to cross. The upper tropical savanna area of M’mouck Leteh, Atsuala, Magha and Fonenge have few streams and springs, many of which dry off in the dry season leading to acute water shortage both for household use and irrigation. <br>

            <b> Vegetation</b> <br>
            There are two distinct vegetation types within the Bamumbu area. There is the wooded savanna in the lower part around the villages of Tatung, Along Kong, Nchingang and Banteng and the tropical savanna vegetation at the higher attitudes of M’mouck Leteh, Atsuala, Marita and Magha. The lower wooded zone hold the highest level of flora – timber and non-timber forest species including medicinal plants. Much of the primary forest have been converted to secondary forests and void of major timber species. The tropical savanna zone has grassy vegetation, with isolated patches of forest (stunted trees) or planted eucalyptus trees.
            <br>
            <b> Fauna </b> <br>
            The difference in vegetation type gives rise to a variety of wildlife species (mammals, reptiles, birds and insects). The Environment and Rural Development Foundation (ERUDEF) has listed a number of animal species that could be found in the forest and grassland vegetation of the Bamumbu Court Area – some that are rare or endangered. Amongst others are the primates (chimpanzees and western lowland mountain gorillas) to wild cats like African civets, genets, foxes, stone hayracks, antelopes, deer, cameras, grass cutters and a variety of avifauna species like the banaman turacle, parrots etc. For fear of extermination of the above-mentioned primates the ERUDEF is working alongside the Ministry of Wildlife to create a sanctuary in the form of a community forest though without some resistance from a fraction of the local population.
